# Monitoring Stack with FastAPI, Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki

This project sets up a complete monitoring and observability stack using Docker containers. It includes a sample FastAPI application with automated metrics collection, logging, and visualization.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The stack consists of four main components:

- **FastAPI Application**: A simple web API that serves as our application to monitor
- **Prometheus**: Collects and stores metrics from the FastAPI app (internal access only)
- **Grafana**: Provides dashboards and visualization for metrics and logs
- **Loki**: Aggregates and stores application logs

## üìÅ Project Structure

```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system
- Docker Compose installed

### Running the Stack

1. **Clone or navigate to this directory**
   ```bash
   cd monitoring-stack
   ```

2. **Start all services**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Access the services**
   - FastAPI Application: http://localhost:8000
   - Grafana Dashboard: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin123)
   - Loki: http://localhost:3100
   - Prometheus: Internal access only (accessible through Grafana)

4. **Test the FastAPI app**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000
   curl http://localhost:8000/items/42?q=test
   ```

## üìä What Each Component Does

### FastAPI Application (`app/main.py`)

A simple web API with two endpoints:
- `GET /` - Returns a "Hello World" message
- `GET /items/{item_id}` - Returns item information with optional query parameter

**Key features:**
- Automatic Prometheus metrics collection using `prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator`
- Structured logging that gets sent to Loki
- Health check endpoints for monitoring

### Docker Configuration (`app/Dockerfile`)

- Uses Python 3.12 slim base image
- Installs `uv` for fast Python package management
- Copies dependencies and application code
- Exposes port 8000 for the FastAPI application
- Runs the app using Uvicorn ASGI server

### Docker Compose Setup (`docker-compose.yml`)

Orchestrates four services across two custom networks:

1. **fastapi-app**: Your application container
   - Builds from the local Dockerfile
   - Exposes port 8000 to host
   - Configured to send logs to Loki
   - Connected to both frontend and monitoring networks

2. **prometheus**: Metrics collection service
   - Scrapes metrics from the FastAPI app
   - Stores time-series data
   - Internal access only (no host port binding)
   - Connected to monitoring network only

3. **grafana**: Visualization and dashboards
   - Pre-configured to connect to Prometheus and Loki
   - Persistent data storage using Docker volumes
   - Web UI available at port 3000
   - Connected to both frontend and monitoring networks

4. **loki**: Log aggregation service
   - Collects logs from all containers
   - Provides log querying capabilities
   - Available at port 3100
   - Connected to monitoring network only

## üîß Configuration Details

### Network Architecture

The stack uses two Docker networks for improved security and organization:

- **frontend**: Network for user-facing services (FastAPI, Grafana)
- **monitoring**: Network for internal monitoring services (Prometheus, Loki)

Services are strategically placed:
- FastAPI and Grafana: Both networks (can communicate with all services)
- Prometheus and Loki: Monitoring network only (internal communication)

### Logging Configuration

All services are configured to send logs to Loki using the Docker Loki logging driver:
- Logs are batched for efficiency (batch size: 400)
- Retry configuration (5 retries, 2s max backoff)
- Each service has labeled logs for easy filtering

### Security Features

- **Prometheus**: No external port exposure (internal access only)
- **Network Segmentation**: Separate networks for frontend and monitoring
- **Graceful Shutdowns**: Configured stop signals and grace periods

## üìà Monitoring Your Application

### Viewing Metrics in Prometheus

Since Prometheus is not directly exposed, access it through Grafana:
1. Open Grafana at http://localhost:3000
2. Add Prometheus as a data source: http://prometheus:9090
3. Try these queries:
   - `http_requests_total` - Total HTTP requests
   - `http_request_duration_seconds` - Request duration
   - `rate(http_requests_total[5m])` - Request rate per second

### Creating Dashboards in Grafana

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Log in with admin/admin123
3. Add data sources:
   - Prometheus: http://prometheus:9090
   - Loki: http://loki:3100
4. Create dashboards combining metrics and logs

### Viewing Logs in Grafana

1. Go to Explore section in Grafana
2. Select Loki as data source
3. Use queries like: `{service="fastapi"}`

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tips

### Adding New Metrics

Add custom metrics to your FastAPI app:
```python
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram

REQUEST_COUNT = Counter('app_requests_total', 'Total requests', ['method', 'endpoint'])
REQUEST_DURATION = Histogram('app_request_duration_seconds', 'Request duration')
```

### Debugging Services

Check individual service logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs fastapi-app
docker-compose logs prometheus
docker-compose logs grafana
docker-compose logs loki
```

### Stopping the Stack

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To remove volumes and clean up completely:
```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port conflicts**: Ensure ports 3000, 8000, and 3100 are not in use
2. **Docker permissions**: Run with `sudo` if you encounter permission issues
3. **Service not starting**: Check logs with `docker-compose logs [service-name]`

### Health Checks

- FastAPI: `curl http://localhost:8000/health` (if implemented)
- Prometheus: Check through Grafana (no direct access)
- Grafana: Check if web UI loads at http://localhost:3000
- Loki: `curl http://localhost:3100/ready`

## üìö Next Steps

1. **Add more endpoints** to your FastAPI application
2. **Create custom Grafana dashboards** for your specific metrics
3. **Set up alerting rules** in Prometheus
4. **Configure Grafana alerts** for important metrics
5. **Add more applications** to monitor by extending the docker-compose.yml
